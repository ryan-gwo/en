that there were too many mad teachers at the university.ðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This semester there are three courses: Optics, Theoretical Mechanics
and Mathematical Methods for Physics. The only one that&#39;s normal is MMP
(after all, it&#39;s the God of MMP, Guoquan Zhou). But the teachers of the
remaining two classes are a bit crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theoretical-mechanics&quot;&gt;Theoretical Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The textbook is Landau, which is not suitable for beginners. This
book is not suitable as a textbook for beginners, it has no mathematical
details and the notation is different from other books. In the end, I
chose to follow along with other books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&#39;m a sophomore, sophomore, sophomore, and I haven&#39;t finished the
math and physics stuff yet, and even though you&#39;re in astrophysics and
I&#39;m interested in it, all of a sudden there&#39;s a lot of metrics and
general relativity and abstract metrics and tensor analysis and it just
makes me feel like I&#39;m taking a very abstract class.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, on a sphere: <spanclass="math display">\[\begin{equation}\label{eq3}\mathrm{d}s^2=R^2\mathrm{d}\theta^2+R^2\sin^2\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi^2.\end{equation}\]</span></p><h2 id="write-the-pythagorean-theorem-in-quadratic-form">Write thePythagorean theorem in quadratic form</h2><p>Although the Pythagorean theorem holds in different spaces andcoordinate systems, their forms seem to be less uniform (e.g. <spanclass="math inline">\(\eqref{eq1}\)</span>, <spanclass="math inline">\(\eqref{eq2}\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(\eqref{eq3}\)</span>). But each of them is asquare term. This prompted us to think of the quadratic forms we learnedin linear algebra. So we try to write the above three Pythagoreantheorems in the form of quadratic matrices: <spanclass="math inline">\(\eqref{eq3}\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(\eqref{eq3}\)</span>. <spanclass="math display">\[\begin{align}\mathrm{d}s^2&amp;=\begin{pmatrix}\mathrm{d}x&amp;\mathrm{d}y\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0\\0&amp;1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\mathrm{d}x\\\mathrm{d}y\end{pmatrix},\\[12pt]\mathrm{d}s^2&amp;=\begin{pmatrix}\mathrm{d}\rho&amp;\mathrm{d}\varphi\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0\\0&amp;\rho^2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\mathrm{d}\rho\\\mathrm{d}\varphi\end{pmatrix},\\[12pt]\mathrm{d}s^2&amp;=\begin{pmatrix}\mathrm{d}\theta&amp;\mathrm{d}\varphi\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}R^2&amp;0\\0&amp;R^2\sin^2\theta\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\mathrm{d}\theta\\\mathrm{d}\varphi\end{pmatrix}.\end{align}\]</span> It turns out that <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\mathrm{d}s^2\equiv\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\rho}^\mathrm{T}\,G\,\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\rho}.\end{equation}\]</span> Uniform in form, now that's a good thing. We can write ageneralized form <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\mathrm{d}s^2=\begin{pmatrix}\mathrm{d}\rho^1&amp;\cdots&amp;\mathrm{d}\rho^s\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}g_{11}&amp;\cdots&amp;g_{1s}\\\vdots&amp;\ddots&amp;\vdots\\g_{s1}&amp;\cdots&amp;g_{ss}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\mathrm{d}\rho^1\\\vdots\\\mathrm{d}q^s\end{pmatrix}.\end{equation}\]</span> So we define the matrix <spanclass="math inline">\(g_{ab}\)</span> as a <strong>metric</strong>. Sothe above three examples and other spatial/targeting metrics are clear:P.</p><p>So to summarize, the <strong>metric is a generalization of thePythagorean theorem to infinitesimal distances</strong>.</p>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;The key lies in the fact that Prof. Gao combines some of our existing

concepts in a more concise and easy-to-understand language.&lt;/p&gt;
